# Flappy Bird 

This game is just like normal Flappy Bird game but it's made with the magic of Python which allows you to modify it to satisfy your God's complex. You'll thank me later.

## Rules

In case you were out in the wild for the last decade and you don't know the rules of this extremely popular game:

+ Flap the wings
+ Beware of the obstacles
+ Don't cry (it won't help you)

## Keyboard Map

+ SPACE to start / flap
+ P     to pause
+ R     to resume
+ Q     to quit

P.S. If game is paused, SPACE resumes the game with an instant flap.

## Modification

I welcome all mod proposals. If you have any, PULL REQUEST will help you to get it merged in (if I like it).

## Finally

With love from Viktor A. Rozenko Voitenko
